# Changelog

All notable changes to Imagina Signatures are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Editor and admin pages rendered blank because `<script src="...">` tags were missing `type="module"`. With Vite's per-entry chunk splitting, `editor.js` and `admin.js` import a shared bundle, which only works when the script tag is loaded as an ES module. Both PHP hosts now emit `type="module"`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial public release scaffolding (Sprints 1–12).
- Core: PSR-4 autoloader, DI container, lifecycle (Activator / Deactivator / Uninstaller), schema migrator, capability installer.
- Storage: pluggable `StorageDriverInterface` with Media Library and S3-compatible drivers; SigV4 signer + S3Client + presigned URL builder; provider presets (Cloudflare R2, Bunny, S3, B2, Spaces, Wasabi, custom). Encryption service for credential storage.
- REST API: signatures CRUD, templates (open read / admin write), uploads (init / direct / finalize), storage admin, `/me`. Capability + ownership middleware, rate limiter.
- Editor: React 18 iframe app with dnd-kit drag-and-drop, Tiptap-based text editing on the email-safe whitelist, eleven block types (text, heading, image, avatar, divider, spacer, social_icons, contact_row, button_cta, disclaimer, container), undo/redo (50-deep), debounced autosave.
- Compiler: JSON → email-safe HTML pipeline (shell + Outlook fixes + minification + validation warnings).
- Templates: two seeded templates (`minimal-modern`, `corporate-classic`).
- Polish: error boundary, toast notifications, multi-client preview modal, export modal (Copy + Download).

### Known limitations

- Eight of ten templates from the spec roadmap still need to be authored before public release.
- Bullet-proof VML buttons for Outlook 2007–2019 are stubbed; the standard CSS button works in most clients.
- Nested drag-and-drop into containers ships in a follow-up.
- `POST /admin/storage/migrate` (cross-driver asset migration) is intentionally deferred — it needs a long-running task scheduler.
- Cross-client visual QA (real Outlook / Gmail / Apple Mail) is manual and pending.
